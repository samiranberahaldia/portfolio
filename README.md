# **Work Experience**

## **Senior Data Scientist**, Blackhawk Network, India  
*(March 2022 – Present)*  
1. **Developed Direct-to-Consumer Fraud Detection Model**:  
   - Designed **XGBoost** model integrated with **KMeans clustering** for risk profile categorization.  
   - Improved fraud detection metrics: increased recall score and critical success index (~6%).  
   - Enhanced business metrics: approval rate & net profit (~3%), and reduced chargeback & opportunity cost (~15%).  
   - Replaced external risk vendors, improving organizational control on order approvals (~3%).  

2. **Enhanced Existing Fraud Detection Model**:  
   - Introduced new predictors by developing fraudster profiling using statistical measures.  
   - Conducted model retraining with cross-validation, backtesting, and champion-challenger tests.  
   - Improved fraud identification, reducing significant chargebacks (~17%).  

3. **Developed Proof-of-Concept for Customer Segmentation**:  
   - Implemented **RFM analysis** and **KMeans clustering**.  

4. **PowerBI Dashboard Development**:  
   - Built dashboards to monitor 800+ brand performances using business KPIs.
